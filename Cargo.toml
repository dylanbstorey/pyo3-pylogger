# serde-pyobject currently has too strict of a version constraint which makes it incompatible with our library.
# We are waiting on a PR to be merged which will fix this.

# https://github.com/Jij-Inc/serde-pyobject/pull/21
#
# Additionally, I have 2 other PRs open which will add additional features such as support for Pydantic BaseModels, dataclasses, and more.
